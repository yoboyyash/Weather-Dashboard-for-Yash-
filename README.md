![Alt text](./Screenshot%202024-01-03%20191756.png)

HOW TO USE: Load up this fire app and enter the city you would like to see the current weather and it's five days of forecast. 

Results: This app will allow you to see the weather forecast for the city you enter and also save it for the future for you to call upon via a list. You can view multiple cities. 

This project is helping me build a webapp so that I know how to go about creating not just a fully interactive webpage with stylesheet and script but also add functions that I find suitable to solve acceptance criteria. I understand in the future of web developement I will be required to meet everything asked according to the client anyone I work for. This assignment really helped me navigate on my own how to research and apply code to meet requirements whilst keeping the visual design intergrity of the original code.

Along with being tested on understanding of creating a webapp I am adding something valuable to my job seeking tools. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

 * Add functions that are unique and meets the requirement of the password creation to accomplish results for users   
 * Create elements via the DOM 
 * Connect web APIs to my project and use select information to display on webapp for users to view and interact with
 * Create a html, css, and js file
 * Create a repository on github and use gitbash terminal to locally keep code files updated online
 * Deploy all built code to gitpages so to have a website
 * Structure code schemantics in a way so you or anyone else can continue working on this project in the future
